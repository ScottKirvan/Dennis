# dennis - an Unreal Asset

Please ignore this repo for now, you're welcome to use it if you wish, but I'm just doing some githug/unreal testing.

The assets are the 100k *dennis* model from https://renderpeople.com/ modified with an 18% grey material.

> **Warning** this is an asset exported from Unreal Engine 5.2 Preview and uses the experimental Substance Shading Subsustem
